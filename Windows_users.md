Using PUTTY
-----------

This is the means of connecting from your Windows computers to one of the servers in Sweden ;)

The following is when you don't have a CUBE account:

``` bash
IP: 130.235.46.23
Login as: lokesh
password: a*****a
```

If you have a CUBE account:

``` bash
IP: vlogin4.csb.univie.ac.at
Login as: YOUR_USER_NAME
password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```


Click yes for the first question (if any). This question will not appear again.

Start with the following command (it will only work in Lokesh's account):

``` bash
cowsay MOO
```

LOL :D

Then you can check what kinds of files I have in my home folder in Sweden:

``` bash
ls
```

I know I have a LOT of files in this computer!

<span style="color:red"> **PLEASE Make sure you don't mess with my files! Do the following and work there, thanks!** </span>

``` bash
mkdir YOUR_NAME
cd YOUR_NAME
```

There you go!!! Now you are all set!!!
