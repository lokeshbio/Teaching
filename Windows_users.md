Using PUTTY

### If you have CUBE account

``` bash

Now, you can skip the rest and continue with "Material\_1.pdf"

### If you DONT have CUBE account

This is the means of connecting from your Windows computers to one of the servers in Sweden ;)

Click yes for the first question (if any). This question will not appear again.

Start with the following command:

``` bash
cowsay MOO
```

LOL :D

Then you can check what kinds of files I have in my home folder in Sweden:

``` bash
ls
```

I know I have a LOT of files in this computer!

<span style="color:red"> **PLEASE Make sure you don't mess with my files! Do the following and work there, thanks!** </span>

``` bash
mkdir YOUR_NAME
cd YOUR_NAME
```

There you go!!! You are all set!!! Now, you can continue with "Material\_1.pdf"
